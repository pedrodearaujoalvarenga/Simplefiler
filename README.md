# Simplefiler
An easy-to-use class for file exporting on Android App Studio.
This one's pretty simple.

## Constructor:

Simplefiler(name-of-the-file, format-of-the-file)
  
  Once you create it, it'll automatically start creating a file. This file will be located on Android root.
  
  
## Methods:
  
  yourSimplefiler.writeString("Your string");
  yourSimplefiler.writeInt(your-int);
  
  those two are pretty intuitive.
  
And, finally,
  
  yourSimplefiler.end();
  This will save the changes and finish the creation of the file. 
  
  Just did this class to an app and maybe it would be useful for someone.
